# doviz_takip_currency_tracking_app

For the first time, in a project where I used API services, I'm fetching the equivalent value of the selected currency in other units to display on the screen. 
It's a simple design live currency tracking system built using Flutter. 

It is one of my "Do it-Learn it" and "Practice makes perfect" themed Flutter projects. 


Here are the screenshots of my app :
